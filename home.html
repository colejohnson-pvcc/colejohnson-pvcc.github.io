            <h1>Why Impeachment Exists</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">As America is a democracy, the people of this nation are the ones who elect candidates that they believe will best serve this country, 
            and it is the responsibility of those who are elected to act in the best interest of the people and the nation whom they serve. 
            However, as we can see in the history of our country, those whom citizens have put their trust in and granted power to maintain their beliefs and rights,
            often sought their own interests and have acted in ways to improve their own status and not the people they have pledged to serve.
            Because the founders of this nation recognized this danger and to ensure the safety and prosperity of America, 
            they granted Congress the power and means to remove such officials from office through the process of impeachment.</p>
        
            <h1>1. Where Impeachment Begins</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The process of impeachment begins with one of the branches of Congress: the House of Representatives, which was granted the only right to impeach, as is written in Article I of the Constitution.
            This process starts either by the House of Representatives addressing articles, or charges, against an official of the United States Government and launching their own investigation, which is often handled by the Committee in the Judicial branch,
            or more simply, a proposition of impeachment may be presented to them. This is followed by the members of the House of Representatives participating in a vote to see whether or not they believe the official to be guilty of his or her charges, 
            and if the majority agree that the charges set against the official are true, a trial shall then be set and held by the Senate.</p>
        
            <h1>2. Impeachment Trials</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">As the lone right to impeach was granted to one of Congress' branches, it only seemed fair to give the single right to hold trials of impeachment to its other branch: the Senate.
            Once an impeachment case is passed up to the Senate from the House of Representatives, it will proceed in much of the same manner as traditional court cases; however, the prosecution is acted out by members of the House of Representatives,
            and juries are absent with the members of the Senate in their stead. In the case of a presidential impeachment, the Senate's trial will be overseen by the chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court. 
            In order for a conviction to be made in an impeachment trial, at least two-thirds of the senators must vote towards a conviction. If an official is in fact impeached, he or she will be immediately removed from their current position.</p>

            <h1>3. Qualifications for Impeachment</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Those who are subject to impeachment include all federal officials working for the government of the United States of America, including the president and vice president themselves.
            Congress' members, however, are not considered federal officials; thus, they can never be impeached. Those who are eligible for impeachment can and will be impeached if they have in any way participated in the following: 
            <ul> 
                <li>betrayed this country and/or its members</li>
                <li>given or accepted bribes</li>
                <li>committed any offenses or</li>
                <li>misconduct of the law</li>
            </ul>
            </p> 
        
            <h1>4. Punishments of Impeachment</h1>  
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">As previously mentioned, if an official is in fact impeached for any reason, he or she will be immediately dismissed from office no matter what position he or she held prior to the conviction.
            Furthermore, the official who was impeached will be unable to appeal the ruling. In some cases, the Senate will go further and remove the right for that official to be reelected. 
            He or she will then be required to stand trial in civil courts for cash penalties and be tried on whether or not he or she should face time in prison.</p>  

            <h1>A Nation's Past Impeachments</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The idea of impeachment was adopted from an English practice and was put in place in order to keep government officials in check. In our nation's history, 
            we have seen impeachment trials and proceedings against judges, presidents, a cabinet secretary, and a senator, who was the first individual in our country to be tried for impeachment.
            An impeachment investigation launched by the members of the House of Representatives has been used over sixty times in our nation's history. However, twenty-one of these cases have ended in total convictions,
            with only eight having been impeached and dismissed from employment in the U.S. government by the Senate. Furthermore, three of the individuals that were impeached by the Senate had the right to run for office stripped from them.</p>

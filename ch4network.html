        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Network Classifications</p> 
            <li>Lan - A local area network that normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">Man - A metropolitan area network is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">Wan - A wide area network that links machines over a greater distance like neighboring cities or opposite sides of the world.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Network Models</p> 
            <li>bus network - A topology in which the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">star network - A topology in which one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Protocols</p> 
            <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet - Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection is the protocol that controls the right to transmit messages and dictates each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">CSMA/CA Wifi - Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is usually standardized by IEEE within the protocols of IEEE 802.11, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi, and is the protocol designed to avoid collisions but may not eliminate them completely.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Combining networks:</p> 
            <li>repeater - A device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses, usually with some form of amplification, without considering the meaning of the signals.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">bridge - A device that connects two buses and allows the two machines residing on the same side of the bridge to exchange messages without interfering with communications taking place on the other side.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">switch - A device that produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">router - A device which is a special purpose computer used for forwarding messages.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">gateway - The "point" at which one network is linked to an internet. It serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Client/server model</p> 
            <li>p2p: peer-to-peer - A client/server model that involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous others (clients). The peer-to-peer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">distributed system - Systems that consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers. This includes many modern software systems, such as global information retrieval systems, company-wide accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software that controls a network's infrastructure.</li>

            <li>Tier 1 - ISPs that consist of very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs. They are considered the backbone of the Internet.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">Tier 2 - Tier-2 ISPs connect to tier 1 ISPs and tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities. Tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the Internet's communication infrastructure.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">Tier 3 - Tier-3 ISPs provide access to the most or all of the network that remains connected even when very important tier-1 routers fail.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">IP address</p> 
            <li><a href="https://www.icann.org"> ICANN </a> - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation and is responsible for awarding blocks of consecutively numbered IP addresses to ISPs.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">DNS - Domain Name System is a directory system that uses name servers to convert a mnemonic address into an IP address before transmitting messages.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">TLD: Top-level domain - Top-level domains are the suffixes used to reflect a domain's classification. These include .edu for educational, .com for commercial institutions, .gov for U.S. government institutions, .org for nonprofit organizations, .mil for military, and .net which was originally intended for ISPs but is now used on a much broader scale.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;"><a href="https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/"> Country-code TLDS</a> - A top-level domain that uses two-letter TLDs for each specific country, such as .au for Australia and .ca for Canada. Furthermore, hundreds of TLDs were added to the DNS hierarchy, such as .biz for businesses and .museum for museums.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Internet protocols</p> 
            <li>FTP - File Transfer Protocol is an application used for listing and copying files across the network.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a webpage that handles the traditional network applications, such as the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the Telnet protocol, or later, the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.</li>

        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Internet four-layer software</p> 
            <li>application layer - The application layer is where messages usually originate and consists of software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">transport layer - The transport layer accepts messages from the application layer, ensures that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet, divides long messages into small segments called 'packets', and transmits packets across the Internet one segment at a time to the network layer.</li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">network layer - The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction to forward packets. </li> 
            <li style="padding-top:10px;">link layer - The link layer is charged with receiving and transmitting packets and must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.</li> 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Internet is:</p> 
            <li>packet-switching network - Packet switching transmits data across digital networks by breaking it down into blocks or packets for more efficient transfer using various network devices.</li>

                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Requirements analysis - The software life cycle begins with requirements analysis, the goal of which is to specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions (time constraints, security, and so on) on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system. Requirements analysis also involves significant input from stakeholders (future users as well as those with other ties, such as legal or financial interests) of the proposed system.</li> 
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Design - Design involves creating a plan for construction of the proposed system. Design is about developing a solution to the problem. It is the design stage that the internal structure of the software system is established. The result of the design phase is a detailed description of the software system's structure that can be converted into programs.</li> 
                        <li>Testing - Testing was essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirements specification. However, programs are not the only artifacts that are tested during the software development process. Thus, testing is now recognized as only one segment in the overall struggle for quality assurance, which is an objective that permeates the entire software cycle.</li>

                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">glass box testing - A category of tests which includes that the software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test. This includes techniques like Pareto principle and basis path testing.</li> 
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">black box testing - The category called black-box testing, which refers to tests that do not rely on knowledge of the software's interior composition. In short, black-box testing is performed from the user's point of view. In black-box testing, one is not concerned with how the software goes about its task but merely with whether the software performs correctly in terms of accuracy and timeliness.</li> 
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">beta testing - A methodology that falls within the black-box category is beta testing, in which a preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software performs in real-life situations before the final version of the product is solidified and released to the market.</li> 
                        <li>alpha testing - A similar testing to beta testing that is performed at the developer's site.</li>

                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">user documentation - The purpose of user documentation is to explain the features of the software and describe how to use them. It is intended to be read by the user of the software and is therefore expressed in the terminology of the application.</li> 
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">system documentation - The purpose of system documentation is to describe the software's internal composition so that the software can be maintained later in its life cycle. A major component of system documentation is the source version of all the programs in the system.</li> 
                        <li>technical documentation - The purpose of technical documentation is to describe how a software system should be installed and serviced (such as adjusting operating parameters, installing updates, and reporting problems back to the software's developer). Technical documentation of software is analogous to the documentation provided to mechanics in the automobile industry.</li>

                        <li>best defenses against software liability claims - One of the best defenses against software liability claims is to apply sound software engineering principles during the software's development, to use a level of care compatible with the software's application, and to produce and maintain records that validate these endeavors.</li>
